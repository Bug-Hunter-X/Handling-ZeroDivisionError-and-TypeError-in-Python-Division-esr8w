# Python: Handling ZeroDivisionError and TypeError in Division

This repository demonstrates a Python function that gracefully handles `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` exceptions during division.

The `bug.py` file contains the function with potential errors, while `bugSolution.py` shows how to correctly handle these exceptions.

The code uses a `try-except-else` block for comprehensive error handling.  A custom exception could be implemented to provide more context.

## Running the Code

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run the Python script using a Python interpreter: `python bug.py`
4. Observe the output and the way the function handles various inputs, including division by zero and incorrect operand types.
